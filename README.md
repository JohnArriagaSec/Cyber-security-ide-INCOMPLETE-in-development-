# ⚙️ [IDE Name] (In Development)

A cybersecurity-focused IDE built for malware analysis, reverse engineering, and security research.

This project is currently **early-stage and under active development**. The goal is to create a lightweight IDE tailored specifically for security workflows — not general-purpose coding.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most IDEs are built for software development first.  
This IDE is being designed **from the ground up for cybersecurity**, especially:

- Malware analysis
- Reverse engineering
- Blue team / red team tooling
- Security research & learning

---

## 🔐 Planned Features

### Core
- Project-based workspace for security labs
- Built-in terminal
- Syntax highlighting for:
  - Python
  - Assembly (x86/x64)
  - PowerShell
  - C / C++
- Dark theme by default (because obviously)

### Malware Analysis
- Static analysis panel
  - File hashes (MD5 / SHA1 / SHA256)
  - Strings extraction
  - File metadata
- Dynamic analysis hooks (future)
- Safe file handling (no accidental execution)

### Reverse Engineering
- Integration support for tools like:
  - Ghidra
  - x64dbg
  - radare2
- Disassembly viewing panel
- Notes/comments tied to addresses or functions

### Security Tooling
- Built-in scripts runner
- YARA rule editor
- Log and output viewer
- Network / process monitoring (planned)

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Security-first
- Minimal and distraction-free
- Designed for **learning + real-world analysis**
- Easy to extend with custom tools and scripts

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- [x] Project planning
- [x] Feature roadmap
- [ ] Core editor engine
- [ ] UI framework
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Analysis modules

Expect breaking changes.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Tentative)

- Language: Python
- UI: TBD (Qt / Electron / other)
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This IDE is for **educational and defensive security purposes only**.  
Do not use this project for illegal activity.

---

## 📌 Notes

This project is part of my long-term cybersecurity learning path, especially malware analysis and reverse engineering.

Feedback and ideas are welcome once the project stabilizes.
